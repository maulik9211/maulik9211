I have a Masters's degree in the field of Information Technology. Currently, I work with companies as a freelance software engineer and try to optimize their business processes by leveraging IT solutions. I select the technology stack depending on the Project's needs. Till now, I have worked in Symphony Framework(PHP), Node.js, Vue.js, React, React Native, PostgresSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, PouchDB/CouchDB. I also work as a consultant for companies to provide them with optimal and cost-effective cloud solutions as I am familiar with AWS, Azure, and GCP services.
